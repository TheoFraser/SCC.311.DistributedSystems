# SCC.311.DistributedSystems
Coursework1 : Built a simple client-server system that invokes a method using Java RMI.

Coursework2 : Updated the client-server system to an auctioning system with aunthenication using RSA keys (2048).

Coursework3 : Updated the auctioning system to use passive replication with a stateless front-end. Also made the system Fault Tolerant so if the front-end crashes the primary replica will take over.
